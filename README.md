# CoWin Vaccine slot checker
This is a simple script to check the availability of slots in perticular area (by Pincode). The script runs every 10 mins.

## Steps
- Install the Node Modules
- Creat a .env file and add `PINCODE` and `TOEMAIL`
- Use your mail server config with `nodemailer` to send mails. I have used Gmail OAuth2.
